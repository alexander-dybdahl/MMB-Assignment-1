    "\n",
    "#### Test Decision\n",
    "- To make a decision, you compare the LR test statistic to a critical value from the chi-squared distribution at a certain significance level (commonly $0.05$) and with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters.\n",
    "- If the LR test statistic is greater than the critical value, you reject the null hypothesis. This means $\\text{Model 1}$ provides a significantly better fit than Model 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Your Case\n",
    "- With an LR test statistic of 149.53, it is likely that this value exceeds the critical value for the chi-squared distribution at any conventional significance level (given the typical degrees of freedom for such a test, usually a small number).\n",

    "- Based on this test, $\\text{Model 1}$ ($\\text{Model}_\\text{pref}$) would be considered the preferred model over $\\text{Model 0}$, as it significantly improves the fit to the data.\n",
    "- However, it's important to also consider the interpretability and theoretical justification of the additional parameters in $\\text{Model 1}$. Sometimes a more complex model is not preferable if it does not add meaningful explanatory power or if it makes the model less interpretable."
